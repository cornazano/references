  Courtney Eckhardt,
  ["How to Have an Operational Incident"](../bibliography/conference_talks.md/#eckhardt-2019).

  Covers the reasons why we need a response framework and an explanation
  of what it should, at minimum, include.
  Draws on the emergency response frameworks used in Canada
  and The United States.

  Emily Freeman,
  ["This IS NOT Fine - Putting Out (Code) Fires"](../bibliography/conference_talks.md/#freeman-2018).

  Learning about incident management through the experience
  of firefighters. Discusses FIRESCOPE (Firefighting Resources
  of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies),
  which identified four areas of focus when dealing with emergencies:
  _flexiblity_, _consistency_, _standardization_, and _budget_.
  FIRESCOPE evolved into NIMS (national incident management system),
  which standardized resources, processes, and terminology
  across all emergency response services.
  Presents the FEMA incident command hierarchy, and suggests a lighter
  organization adapted to technology organizations.

  Betsy Beyer et al.,
  [_The Site Reliability Workbook_](../bibliogrpahy/books.md/#beyer-murphy-rensin-kawahara-thorne-2018).

  One of the major points of Site Reliability Engineering as a discipline is
  to effectively detect, understand, and mitigate incidents.
  Chapters 2, 4, and 5 of this book discuss how to work with service level
  _indicators_ and _objectives_ to have better detection of issues that
  actually affect people who depend on services we offer.
  Chapters 8, 9, and 10 cover major topics in the full incident lifecycle:
  readiness to respond (being on call), management of active incidents,
  and the post-incident learning process to improve for the future.
