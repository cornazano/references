Recommended works:

* Betsy Beyer et al., [_The Site Reliability Workbook_](../bibliogrpahy/books.md/#beyer-murphy-rensin-kawahara-thorne-2018).

  One of the major points of Site Reliability Engineering as a discipline is
  to effectively detect, understand, and mitigate incidents.
  Chapters 2, 4, and 5 of this book discuss how to work with service level
  _indicators_ and _objectives_ to have better detection of issues that
  actually affect people who depend on services we offer.
  Chapters 8, 9, and 10 cover major topics in the full incident lifecycle:
  readiness to respond (being on call), management of active incidents,
  and the post-incident learning process to improve for the future.
