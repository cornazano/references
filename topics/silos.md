# Silos

A primary theme in DevOps discussions is the need to address functional siloization within
our organizations.
The use of the term _silo_ goes back to at least 1988 (per the Wikipedia article on
[information silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo)).
This page collects some of the materials I've been looking at to learn more about the
effects of silos and how we can mitigate against the more problematic aspects.

> I'm not far enough in my reading to have specific recommended resources.
> These are things I'm looking at as part of my exploratory work on the topic.
