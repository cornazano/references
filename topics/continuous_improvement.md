Books:

* Deming, W. Edwards. 2000 (1986/1982). _Out of the Crisis_. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

  Discusses improvement through PDCA, and the use of runcharts to understand how
  repeated processes are operating.
  A key point: variation needs to be controlled for stability of repeating processes.

* Goldratt, Eliyahu M. and Jeff Cox. 2014 (1984). _The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement_. 4 th Rev. Ed. Great Barrington, MA: North River Press.

  The theory of constraints are introduced here.
  A key concept is that the primary constraint in a value stream (the bottleneck)
  is the only place where improvements will actually help the overall throughput.
  Improvements before it will just pile up more inventory at the bottleneck,
  while improvements after it will just further starve the step.
