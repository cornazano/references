# Continuous Improvement

I take a lot of inspiration from Mike Rother's work on the Improvement and Coaching Katas.

Recommended works:

* :green_book:
  Mike Rother,
  [_Toyota Kata_](../bibliography/books.md/#rother-2010).

  Introduces the improvement kata as a scientific-thinking pattern for improving processes,
  and the coaching kata as a way to develop people's ability to use this pattern.

  [_The Toyota Kata Practice Guide_](../bibliography/books.md/#rother-2018)

  Mike Rother,
  ["Toyota Kata: Daily Practice for Scientific-Thinking Skill, Mindset & Culture"](../bibliography/conference_talks.md/#rother-2017).

* :movie_camera:
  J. Paul Reed,
  ["The Five Dirty Words of CI"](../bibliography/conference_talks.md/#reed-2018)

  Root Cause Analysis.
  Five Whys.
  Human Error.
  Counterfactuals (why didn't you...).
  Best practice.

* :green_book:
  W. Edwards Deming,
  [_Out of the Crisis_](../bibliography/books.md/#deming-2000).

  Discusses improvement through PDCA, and the use of runcharts to understand how
  repeated processes are operating.
  A key point: variation needs to be controlled for stability of repeating processes.

* :green_book:
  Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox,
  [_The Goal_](../bibliography/books.md/#goldratt-cox-2014).

  The theory of constraints are introduced here.
  A key concept is that the primary constraint in a value stream (the bottleneck)
  is the only place where improvements will actually help the overall throughput.
  Improvements before it will just pile up more inventory at the bottleneck,
  while improvements after it will just further starve the step.

  [_The Toyota Way to Continuous Improvement_](../bibliography/books.md/#liker-franz-2011).
