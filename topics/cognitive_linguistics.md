  This talk reviews Lakoff and Johnson's _Metaphors We Live By_ and applies the ideas
  to operations.
  I'd never read it (although I was aware of it for several years, and watching this
  in 2017 reminded me about the book and prompted me to finally read it.

  George Lakoff,
  ["Cognitive Models and Prototype Theory"](../bibliography/papers_posts_other.md/#lakoff-1987).

  Discusses multiple interpretations of prototype theory, and argues for
  a _cognitive model_ interpretation.
  Argues that two other interpretations, the _effects = structure_ interpretation
  and the _prototype = representation_ interpretation, both generate incorrect
  predictions.
  Covers, among other topics, _graded models_, _metonymic models_, and _radial structures_.
